# *About the project:*
This is my portfolio website, created with HTML & CSS and it can be used both from laptop and mobile.

It tells you a little bit about me, about my skills and little by little I'm updating it with new projects.

It also has a "contact" section where you can send me and email if you have questions or if you're interested in my work.
